gavia \- bird notebook tools

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Gavia is a set of tools used to create,
share, maintain and present bird notebooks.
.LP
It is centered around the
.I excursion
concept, i.e. you write down where you were, the time and day,
weather et cetera, and what species you saw.
.LP
.BR gavia_stellata (1)
is the primary tool for entering excursions.
.LP
Since it's just a text file,
a Gavia book may be shared between several birders using tools such as
.BR git (1).
This also makes it more likely that the data stays accessible far into the future.
