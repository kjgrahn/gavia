.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B gavia_cat
concatenates one or more Gavia (''Gab'') files
given on the command line.
A dash '\-' denotes standard input.
Standard input is also used if no
book files are mentioned.
The resulting aggregate book is then written to
standard output, either as a
Gavia book (i.e. binary),
as text,
as ''gab'' formatted text,
as HTML,
troff source code,
or a Unix mailbox file.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP \-g
(default) Output as ''gab'' text, which gavia_add(1) can read.
.IP \-t
Output as pretty-printed plain text.
.IP \-h
Output as HTML,
with each excursion as a HTML table.
.IP \-m
Output as a mbox file, readable by mail user agents such as
.BR mail (1)
or
.BR mutt (1).
.IP \-r
Output as
.BR troff (1)
+
.BR tbl (1)
source.
This can then be rendered in different ways; you might for example
want to create a PostScript version using
.BR groff (1):
.br
.ft CW
groff -mm -t -Tps file > file.ps
.
.IP --check
Don't output anything; just check the input for errors.
.IP \-c
(default) Output the species in the order they appear in the input.
.IP \-x
Output the species according to the taxonomic ordering specified by
.IR lib/gavia/species .
.IP --version
Print version information and exit.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I lib/gavia/species
The list of supported species and their taxonomic ordering.
.SH "BUGS"
Error handling and error reporting is rudimentary, at the most.
Bad file contents give unrecoverable errors.
The Gavia book format is fucked up.
.LP
Mbox output isn't MIME-encoded; some mail user agents
may be confused when encountering 8-bit characters in
mail headers and bodies.
