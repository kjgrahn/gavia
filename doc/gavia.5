gavia \- Gavia bird note book formats
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Two different file formats are used with Gavia:
the text format tentatively called ''gab'', and
the older, binary format ''Lanius book''.
Different Gavia commands work on different kinds of
files.
.SH "GAB FILES"
The ''Gab'' input format is designed so that
a user can start with a template file
and quickly edit it, marking the species
seen during an excursion
and filling in any extra information.
.LP
Blank lines are ignored.
Comment lines (prefixed with a hash (#) sign)
are ignored.
Case and extra blank space
is not significant except for in species names
and user-supplied data.
.LP
Input is line-oriented; fields may never
be broken into several lines.
.LP
The input consists of a series of excursions,
each looking like
.IP

A species field can be unfilled, in which case that species
won't be regarded as included in the excursion.

The number of individuals and/or comment may still be left out,
but in that case the user must fill in the mark field
with some non-blank characters, for example an '#'.
