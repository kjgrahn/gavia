Major changes (with focus on user-visible changes) to Gavia, per version.

_________________________________________

	- internal: recursive Makefiles replaced with a single one,
	  and CPPUNIT-based tests replaced with testicle-based ones.

gavia 3.1 (2007-06-25)
        - one species added; new grand total 538 species.
	  vitbukig flyghöna

gavia 3.0 (2007-06-25)
	- The text file format now supports splitting things across
	  several lines (aka continuation lines) for readability. For
	  example,

          place  : Falköpings tätort (Fredriksberg, Ranten),
		   Mösseberg (Bredablick--Klevautsikten, Hörnemosseutsikten)

	  trana  :#:  9: 2+3 gick S om Näset;
			 2 sjön--Uggleskogen;
			 1 vassudden;
			 1 N om sjön

          All utilities can provided with Gavia can handle this. Some
	  preserve the lines, others (e.g. gavia_stat) have to merge
	  them into one long line.

gavia 2.39 (2006-02-14)
	- gavia_cat: HTML output now uses tables, for more attractive
	  (less ugly) layout.

gavia 2.38 (2006-01-04)
        - gavia_add: fixed recent, minor -v bug.

gavia 2.37 (2006-01-03)
	- gavia_stellata: indent species listings with TAB characters
	  and spaces, not just spaces. This can save significant
	  amounts of disk/network/backup space.

gavia 2.36 (2006-01-02)
	- Bug fix: if you called 'gavia_stellata foo' with 'foo' being
	  a directory or something, you would lose the excursion you
	  entered, and not told until the end.

	  gavia_stellata now checks 'foo' so it's both writeable and a
	  normal file, and does not delete the temporary file
	  containing the excursion in case of error.

gavia 2.35 (2005-10-30)
	- Implemented gavia-mode, a GNU Emacs editing mode for 'gab'
	  excursion files in general and gavia_stellata(1) in
	  particular. This adds some color highlighting, and also
	  makes the [F4] key mark a species as seen.

	  See README for details.

	- Removed the old recipe for marking a species as seen using a
	  crude Emacs macro.

gavia 2.34 (2005-01-06)
	- simple error checking on dates in 'gab' files added.  Broken
	  dates kept popping up in various files (typically like
	  "200408", with the day-of-month omitted) and that was
	  silently accepted, then transformed to really unreasonabke
	  values, like dates in 2026.

	- excursions saved in mailbox format used to have a bracket
	  '{' missing.  Fixed.

gavia 2.33 (2004-08-05)
        - two species (or subspecies, maybe) added; new grand total
          537 species:
	  svarthuvad gulärla
	  nordafrikansk blåmes

gavia 2.32 (2004-08-04)
	- nineteen species added (new grand total 535):
	  afrikansk klippsvala    klipphöna
	  alpkaja		  marmorand
	  atlasgröngöling	  svartvingad glada
	  berberfalk		  palmduva
	  ökenberglärka		  sandökenlärka
	  vitkronad stenskvätta	  stenökenlärka
	  bergsökenfink		  berberstenskvätta
	  diademrödstjärt	  trädgårdsbulbyl
	  eremitibis		  balearisk lira
	  hussparv
	- rearranged the taxonomic order within some groups
	- rearranged lib/default, too: slightly different order,
	  and more species moved to the 'rarities' section

gavia 2.31 (2004-04-24)
        - gavia_cat et al: better handling of unrecognized
          command-line options.
	- do not compile with hashmap by default
	- preprocessor fixes: now compiles with gcc 3.4.0
	- minor internal changes

gavia 2.30 (2004-01-06)
	- gavia_stellata: column formatting is applied before the new
	  excursion(s) are appended to the book, so that the species
	  and number columns aren't unnecessarily wide.
	- gavia_stellata: the user may specify an excursion template
	  on the command line
	- gaviadate and gaviadeexpand utilities (which gavia_stellata
	  used to call, alongside cat(1)) removed.  Gavia_stellata now
	  calls no external programs except the editor.
	- gavia_add: slightly better diagnostics

gavia 2.29 (2003-01-05)
	- one new species added (new total 516):
	  buffelhuvud
	- gavia_cat(1): output to text, *roff and html prints the
	  weekday alongside the date

gavia 2.28 (2002-10-20)
	- one new species added (new total 515):
	  mongolpiplärka
	- the script 'deka', used for pulling out statistics and plotting
	  data over time, is now included (but not installed by default,
	  and not documented)
	- removed the possibility to export to LaTeX source; use
	  (t)roff export instead to get a Postscript/PDF/printed version
	  of a Gavia book
	- removed support for misspelling
	  gräshoppsångare
	  rostskogstrast
	  bergstaigasångare
	- less stupid 'gavia_cat -v' output
	- lib/default, the gavia_stellata(1) template, now
	  includes all species known to gavia
	- 'Using Gavia in combination with CVS' pretty much rewritten
	- exporting exursions to various formats using gavia_cat(1)
	  now uses external Perl scripts to do the actual export,
	  at least for plain text, troff source and HTML.
	  Perl is better at this kind of thing than C++...
	  The scripts may also be used standalone.
	- fixed a small number of bugs which manifested themselves
	  when compiling with gcc 3.0

gavia 2.27 (2002-08-11)
	- gavia_cat(1) can now output as troff+tbl source; this
	  is probably the best way to create a PostScript, PDF or
	  printed version of your observations so far
	  (and it looks good on a text screen, too)
        - eight new species added (new total 514):
	  svartbrynad albatross
	  dvärgsnögås
	  svangås
	  gulkindad kricka
	  slagfalk
	  tygeltärna
	  eksångare
	  långstjärtad rosenfink
	- taxonomic ordering cleaned up slightly

gavia 2.26 (2002-07-16)
        - three species names were clearly misspelled:
	  gräshoppsångare
	  rostskogstrast
	  bergstaigasångare
	  This is now fixed, but to ease the transition from
	  files with the broken names in them, gavia_add(1)
	  just warns and adjusts.
	- gavia_stellata(1) does syntax checks on the excursions
	  it adds, and checks the species names against the list
	  of accepted names

gavia 2.25 (2002-07-15)
	- the files in lib/ are now installed by default, and gavia_stellata(1) and
	  gavia_focus(1) fall back to using these as config files if there
	  are no user-specific ones, and not to files in the home directory of
	  some hypothetical 'gavia' user
	- lib/gavia_focus changed name to just lib/focus
	- the list of species is now kept in a file, lib/gavia/species,
	  rather than hardcoded into the binaries.  This file defines
	  both the names and the taxonomical order.

gavia 2.24 (2002-07-14)
        - the name change to "större flamingo" (which was what really was intended!)
	  back in 2.22 was broken -- fixed
	- the new species from 2.23 added to lib/default

gavia 2.23 (2002-06-16)
	- five new species added (new total 506)
	  glasögonsångare
	  häcksparv
	  långnäbbad mås
	  svartbukig flyghöna
	  nilgås
	- new utility gavia_score(1) for finding out how frequently
	  different species have been seen
	- gavia_add(1) detects and prevents multiple entries for
	  a species within excursions
	- gavia_stellata(1) can now be aborted by exiting the
	  editor without changes

gavia 2.22 (2001-12-29)
        - "större flamingo" was a synonym for the existing
	  species "flamingo", so the latter was retained and
	  the former ditched. This means that gavia 2.21 is
	  incompatible with all other versions. Fortunately,
	  pretty much noone used it.
	- gavia_stat(1) manpage updated with a couple of examples
	- example gavia_focus(1) rc file made more realistic (Jonas)
	- gavia_cat -m output slightly fixed
	- slightly improved error handling

gavia 2.21 (2001-12-14)
	- 17 new species added (new total 502)
	  större flamingo
	  medelhavsvarfågel
	  svart stenskvätta
	  europeisk kopparand
	  hökörn
	  rödhöna
	  purpurhöna
	  rödnäbbad trut
	  halsbandsparakit
	  munkparakit
	  lagerlärka
	  grässångare
	  svartstare
	  spansk sparv
	  stensparv
	  blåskata
	  alpkråka
	- changed the name of one species -- "östlig svarthakad buskskvätta"
	  is no longer abbreviated to "ö svarth buskskv"

gavia 2.20 (2001-09-30):
	- gavia_focus now has a '-v' flag for inverting the filter
	- the 'bookfile' argument to gavia_add is finally optional

gavia 2.19 (2001-09-27):
	- a new tool, 'gavia_focus', lets you filter away common species
	  during parts of the year -- useful for quickly browsing a large
	  book.

gavia 2.18 (2001-07-22):
	- taxonomic order (gavia_cat -x) now actually presents something
	  resembling what it should (used to be the same as canonical order,
	  i.e. newly added (rare) species tended to sort last)
	- gavia_stellata now uses $GAVIAEDITOR, $VISUAL or $EDITOR
	  for picking the right editor.
	- added 'orientvadarsvala' as a species (new total 485)

gavia 2.17 (2001-07-08):
	- gavia_cat: when exporting to text, the day of week is printed:
	    Date     : 1995-08-03 (Thu)
	    Place    : ...
	- Bug fix: 'make install' now installs the gavia(1) manpage properly.
	- `gaviadate' no longer requires the bloated GNU date(1) command.
	- Minor manpage fix to gavia_stellata(1).

gavia 2.16 (2001-06-19):
	- Gavia_cat can now output to a regular Unix mailbox (mbox) file.
	- New manpages gavia(1) and gavia(5) gives an overview and documents
	  file formats, respectively.
	- New manpage gavia_stellata(1).
	- `gavia_cvs.mm' improved.

gavia 2.15 (2001-06-04):
	- `gavia_cvs.mm' improved.

gavia 2.14 (2001-05-31):
	- New piece of documentation: `Using Gavia in combination with CVS'.
	- Formatting/layout of the generated GAB source changed slightly
	  so that it's easier to read, and matches the template file better.
	- Some manpage, Makefile and source fixes.

gavia 2.13 (2001-01-18):
	- Thirteen new species added (new total 484)
	  "tundrasädgås",
	  "grönländsk bläsgås",
	  "dvärgkanadagås",
	  "svartbukig prutgås",
	  "ljusbukig prutgås",
	  "amerikansk kricka",
	  "amerikansk sjöorre",
	  "östersjötrut",
	  "engelsk sädesärla",
	  "sibirisk gransångare",
	  "svartkråka",
	  "brunsiska",
	  "sibirisk trut"
	- Minor fixes in gavia_stellata(1) and gavia_stat(1).
	- More conformant C++ code; std:: namespace enforced, more or less.
	- gavia_stat(1) documented.
	- Other minor manpage fixes.
	- Misc. Makefile cleanup; some Sun/Forte-support added.
	- Conditional compilation for use of the hash_map container
	  (USE_HASHMAP) and getopt.h (USE_GETOPT_H).

gavia 2.12 (2000-12-17):
	- 'gavia_stellata' now takes the book file as an argument;
	  the name of the template file changed to ~/.gavia_template.
	- Some documentation fixes.

gavia 2.11 (2000-09-13):
	- A default template file for gavia_stellata added to the distribution.

gavia 2.1 -- 2.10;
lanius, all versions:
	Before written history.
