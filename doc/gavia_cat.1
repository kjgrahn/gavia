given on the command line.
A dash '\-' denotes standard input.
Standard input is also used if no
book files are mentioned.
The resulting aggregate book is then written to
standard output, either
as ''gab'' formatted text,
HTML,
troff source code,
or a Unix mailbox file.
.PP
Meanwhile, syntax checking is performed and errors (if any)
are written to standard error.
.PP
Also, the output is normalized in the sense that:
.IP \- 3x
it is reindented
.IP \-
species not marked as seen are removed
.IP \-
commented-out text is removed.

.BR mail (1)
or
.BR mutt (1).
.BP \-r
Output as
.BR troff (1)
+

source.
This can then be rendered in different ways; you might for example
want to create a PostScript version using
.BR groff (1):
.br
.ft CW
groff -mm -t -Tps file > file.ps
.
