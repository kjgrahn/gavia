.SH "NAME"
gavia_cat \- concatenate and translate Gavia books
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B gavia_cat [-bgthlv] [-cxs]
.I bookfile
.B ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B gavia_cat
concatenates one or more Gavia book files
given on the command line.
A dash '-' denotes standard input.
Standard input is also used if no
book files are mentioned.
The resulting aggregate book is then written to
standard output, either as a
Gavia book (i.e. binary),
as text,
as ''gab'' formatted text,
as HTML,
or LaTeX2e source code.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP -b
(default) Output as a Gavia Book.
.IP -g
Output as ''gab'' text, which gavia_add(1) can read.
.IP -t
Output as plain text.
.IP -h
Output as HTML.
.IP -l
Output as LaTeX2e source.
.IP -c
(default) Output the species according
to the "canonical" order.
To be honest, this ordering is fairly meaningless
and just an artifact of how Gavia works internally.
This option - and the ones below - is not meaningful
if the -b option is active.
.IP -x
Output the species according to
a generally accepted taxonomical ordering.
.IP -s
Output the species sorted by name.
.IP -v
Print version information and exit.
.SH "FILES"
N/A.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
The current locale settings might influence certain aspects.
TBD.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
TBD.
.SH "BUGS"
Error handling and error reporting is rudimentary, at the most.
Bad file contents give unrecoverable errors.
The Gavia book format is fucked up.
.B gavia_cat
is written in C++ and might be
fragile and/or non-portable because of that.
